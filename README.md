# Circle_Overlap
This project creates a set of overlapping circles which is colored in an alternating pattern. No two adjecent regions created by the circles will be of the same color.
The circles are created by selecting all possible circles defined by 3 points from 7 total points (35 distinct circles)

Here is an example of the resulting image:
